# Coding-Challenges-Solutions

Since I started learning Javascript this year, I became interested in writing algorithms and solving coding challenges. So I decided to make this repository to save the solutions for some of the problems I solved in the last few months. These solutions are for future references for myself or anyone who might be interested in solving the same problems as I did. For now all the coding challenges in this repository is solved in Javascript, but I will be trying to solve some of the future problems using Python and C as I get more experience with those two languages.

I've provided the links to each problem in each solution.
